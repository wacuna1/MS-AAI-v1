# A Study of Obesity and the Relation to Physical Condition and Eating Habits

## Project Status: Complete 

## Introduction:
Physical condition and eating habits among people can lead to a multitude of complications such as obesity, which represents a pervasive problem in many countries. In this study, we have analyzed an existing dataset (De-La-Hoz-Correa et al., 2019; Palechor & Manotas, 2019), including 2111 records and 17 attributes possibly linked to obesity, and reached two main objectives. Firstly, we have evaluated univariate associations between 14 attributes and obesity level on the entire dataset, thereby identifying the most important factors related to overweight and obesity. Secondly, two different methods have then been tested to predict if a person is overweight/obese or not, based on the most influential attributes associated to overweight or obesity.
